We've been busy beavering away behind the scenes to improve the look of our wedding website pages.

The new page designs offer a clean and easy way for your guests to read all the information they need when coming to your wedding.

Your wedding website will look great on a desktop, tablet or mobile. You just need to add the information and Operation Hitch will do the rest.

## New themes!

We've also now added themes and colours that mean you can customise the look of your wedding website. These themes will soon also be available across all our save the date and invite e-stationairy, so you can have a consistent style across all the communications to your guests.

Currently, there are three themes each with four colours to choose from with more coming soon. You can choose your theme and colour on the settings page when you log into Operation Hitch.
