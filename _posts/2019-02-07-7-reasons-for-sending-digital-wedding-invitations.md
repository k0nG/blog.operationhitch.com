Should you consider paper wedding invites? Is it time to throw etiquette out the window on this one, and switch to the ease of managing your correspondence online? A growing number of couples are opting for this digital route, and there’s enough reason for you to consider it, too. Digital invites are efficient, low-cost, and green. And there’s no need to compromise on style, either. Here’s why sending digital wedding invites is an excellent idea, and how to get around any potential downsides.

## 1. You’ll save money.
The most obvious reason for using digital wedding invites is that it’s cheaper. And given the costs involved in weddings, this is a very welcome benefit for most. The Independent reported that a survey done in 2018 showed that the average cost of a wedding is just over £30,000; an all-time high, and a steep increase from the year before. And while wedding invites are just a small part of a couple’s budget, going paperless will still make a substantial difference. Brides Magazine says it’s suggested to put aside at least 5% of the total wedding budget for stationery. “For example, for an ‘average’ £30,000-budget wedding, you could put £1,500 of it to one side for invites.” That’s a nice amount to be able to spend on the wedding day itself, your honeymoon - or to simply save.

## 2. You’ll save time.
Let’s face it - planning a wedding is time-consuming. And while it’s a fun process, it can also be stressful to give all elements of your big day your full attention. Going paperless is a simple way of saving some time, while not compromising on the quality of your wedding. Think about the ease of just sending invitations off with one click versus the lengthy processes of collecting and writing postal addresses and stamping envelopes.

## 3. It’s easy to stay organised.
Managing correspondence with your guests the old-fashioned way seems hopefully inefficient when you consider the paperless alternative. Having everything in one place, and online, makes it wonderfully easy to stay on top of your guest list. You’ll be able access the information easily and quickly, on a computer or even on your phone, whenever you need to.
It also makes updating things a breeze; you might want to send out reminders, or there could be some last-minute changes you need to communicate to your guests. Doing everything online gives you more control and less stress.

## 4. There’s less room for mistakes.
Sending your communication online leaves little room for mistakes. While sending snail mail involves a small risk of postal errors, you’ll be able to track your online invites easily, and see when your invites get opened. There will also be no risk of losing any postal RSVPs and getting your guest list wrong.

## 5. RSVP-ing is low-hassle.
While you’re saving yourself some valuable money and time, you’re making the process easier for your guests, too. Instead of having to fill in RSVP cards by hand and posting them, your guests can let you know they’ll be attending in a mere few seconds. Easier for them, and quicker for you; you’ll have your final guest list much sooner than when you’d have to wait for cards to trickle in through the post.

## 6. You’ll have some practical extra features.
Doing things online also brings along some welcome extra tools. You can, for instance, easily collect dietary requirements as part of the RSVPs, and you can ask for input from your guests on songs or other creative elements. Your invitations can also easily be customised for different guests, if needed. And, in the early part of the process, you can send you your save the dates from the same place, in the same style as your invitations.

## 7. It’s environmentally friendly.
Going digital will save trees! And why not point this out to your guests? If anyone’s still unconvinced on paperless wedding invites, the environmental argument will surely help make people see the merits of doing things online.

## How to mitigate any downsides to going digital
Weddings are steeped in tradition and it might feel difficult to give yours a more modern twist. Here are some potential drawbacks that often get pointed out, and suggestions of how to get around them.

### Aren’t online invitations less tasteful?
No, they don’t need to be. Modern online [designs](https://blog.operationhitch.com/announcements/2018/08/30/email-improvements/) are just as professional and visually pleasing as paper ones, and there’s a great amount of choice available these days. A good digital invitation can have the same feel and sophistication as a paper one, and it can do the job perfectly of setting the right tone for your wedding day.

### Doesn’t it go against etiquette?
Sure, but times change. Everything is going digital and it’s perfectly expected and acceptable that weddings join this trend. The amount of people who opt for paperless correspondence is growing, and the etiquette police is losing ground.

### What if people aren’t online?
Most people are. But if your 85-year-old aunt isn’t, then you could send her invite to someone who lives close to her, and ask them to pass it on. Or, if you like, you could send digital invitations to your tech-savvy guests, and paper ones to the handful of people who aren’t online. There’s no reason not to mix it up to ensure that everyone gets a personal invitation.

### What if emails don’t arrive?
There is always a risk of emails bouncing (if you make a mistake in the email address) or landing in someone’s spam folder (if the recipient has a strong spam filter). But luckily, you’ll be able to see if people have opened their email. If, after a while, someone hasn’t opened their invite, you can reach out to them to make sure it didn’t get e-lost. Unlike with snail mail, it’s easy to trace your invites online.
