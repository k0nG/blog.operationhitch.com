Hi I'm Matt, I've just launched Operation Hitch and I'm offering exclusive access to some early users. [Sign up here](https://operationhitch.com/) for more information on getting a access.

I've created Operation Hitch to help you and your partner plan your big day. Ditch those paper lists and spreadsheets and plan your special day online. All your plans can be reached from anywhere at anytime meaning you can collaborate on the important details with your loved one. The site also helps you create a personal wedding page to communicate with your guests so all the details of the wedding are available to them online.

Here's some more details why I think Operation Hitch can help reduce the stress of planning your wedding.

##Plan your budget

Set your budget and then add all those essential items you’re going to spend it on. Each item can track the estimated cost and when you have paid the bill, the actual cost. All the time a running total of your budget and actual money spent is displayed so you can keep a eye on where the money's going.

##Compare venues
When searching for the right venue for your wedding it can be hard to compare all the potential options. Operation Hitch’s venue comparison tool gives you an overview of all your potential choices and the costs for that venue.

##Prepare your guest list
Work with your partner to put together the guest list for your wedding. Create digital invites with your guests contact details which can be categorised into groups like 'Brides family' or 'Grooms friends'.

##Send a save the date email

Let your guests know when your big day is taking place via a simple tasteful email. Operation Hitch will send a save the date email to the groups of invites selected by you, so you can send it to your most important guests first. The save the date email also asks invitees to confirm their postal address so you can make sure you send your invite to the right place.

##Make a wedding day information page
You've spent a lot of time planning the little bits that will make your day special. Make sure your guests know whats going on during the day. If you have a multi location wedding, the page can include a map and directions for each location during the day so no one gets lost.


I'm continuing to develop Operation Hitch and there will be more great features coming soon that will make wedding planning even easier for you.
