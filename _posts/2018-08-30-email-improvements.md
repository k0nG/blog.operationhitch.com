Hot on the heels of our [updated wedding page designs](/announcements/2018/07/17/wedding-website-redesign/) we're happy to announce that Save the Date and Invite emails sent from Operation Hitch now match the theme selected for your wedding page.

We wanted your wedding e-stationary to be as great looking as your wedding page so once you've chosen a theme and colour in your Operation Hitch account then this will be used for both your emails and wedding page.

## More customisation!

We wanted to add to the ways you can customise your emails to make them even more unique and fun for your guests. So you can now upload an image and add a custom message within Save the Date and Invite emails.

Also while editing you'll get a live preview of your email so you can see straight away what the email will look like.
